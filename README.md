# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 

This excel file reviews various Kickstarter campaigns throughout multiple countries and examines their financial effectiveness. Kickstarter is like other crowdfunding platforms allowing pledges to have specified incentives depending on the funding amount. 

Campaigns that had a pledge goal of around $5,000.00 had the highest success rate. Crowdfunding launch dates that occurred in early summer months like May and June also had the highest number of successful campaigns. The campaigns with the most successes were Theater with 839 completed projects, and the next most successful amount of projects was Music with 540. Both Music and Theater also had the highest amount of progress in the early summer months. The easiest project to fund appears to also be Music which had a 77% success rate.

Campaigns that targeted a pledge of $10,000.00 had the highest rate of failure. September appeared to be the hardest time of the year to kickstart a new project. Journalism had the fewest amount of Kickstarter campaigns. There were 200 food campaigns: 140 of them failed and only 30 were successful. Food projects appears to be the hardest category to get off the ground.

The average donation per Kickstarter was around $4,000.00. The median pledge was $3,150.00.
